THE BIAS IS NOT ADDITIVE

- current runs
    - testing why small objects are biased
        - run-gg08rtest shear 0.01 and no expand shear true, test if was
          derivatives.  Might not be that useful until we do many such runs,
          since fractional error will be 1.e-3

- sim-dg01
    - run-dg01r33 shear 0.01 with nwalkers=20 to verify we still see high bias
        - I do see the bias!  So it was not just the better guess

- sim-dg02
    - run-dg02r01 nwalkers=40 and few s2n vals (should have used 1000 at the
      high end!)
    - run-dg02r02 same as r01 for more statistics

    - + run-dg02r03 using log spaced s/n value set

    - run-dg02rtest this can be re-used for other purposes
        - already saw going to 80 walkers does't help that much
        - try nwalkers=40 and mca_a=2?
            - looks like crap!  huh...

- sim-dg03  shear 0.08, see if OK at high shear
    - run-dg03r01 nwalkers=40, s/n starting at 10

    - + run-dg03r02 nwalkers=80
        - looks better!  So is it the nwalkers, burnin or the nstep?
            - run with nwalkers=40 but nstep  doubled to 400
            - run with nwalkers=40 but burnin doubled to 800

    - run-dg03r03 nwalkers=40, nstep=400 (doubled nstep, burnin same)
        - looks similar to r02
    - run-dg03r04 nwalkers=40, burnin=800 (doubled burnin, nstep same)
        - looks in between

    - so these are probably burnt in, but more sampling was needed. Real data
      may not burn in as quickly. options:
        - nwalkers=40 burnin=400 nstep=400 known bias
        - nwalkers=80 burnin=400 nstep=200 known bias
        - nwalkers=80 burnin=200 nstep=200 even less burnin
        - nwalkers=40 burnin=400 nstep=800 see if more nstep helps.
            - I think it is more important at this stage to look for better
              accuracy.  Let's do it

    - run-dg03r05 nwalkers=40, burnin=40, nstep=800
        - looks about the same


    - + run-dg03r06
        using prior after
        RUNNING

- sim-eg01 shear 0.08
    -  run-eg01r01 nwalkers=80, burnin=400,nstep=200
    -  run-eg01r02
        draw from priors, pretty high error, just a test
    -  run-eg01r03
        draw from priors, and more nstep

    - + run-eg01r04
        using prior after
        RUNNING

- sim-eg02 shear 0.04
    - trying to see if improves over 0.08, might be a clue
    - + run-eg02r01 nwalkers=80, burnin=400,nstep=200
        - looks quite similar to run-dg01r01

- sim-eg03
    - shear 0.08, size ratio sqrt(2)
    - run-eg03r01, nwalkers=80, rest standard
        - TERRIBLE.  Always low.  Maybe this is from a bad guess?  But that is
          hard to believe.
    - run-eg03r02 Draw guess from priors.
        - Better, but the exp are looking like shit.  What is going on?

- sim-dg04
    - shear 0.08, size ratio sqrt(2)
    - run-dg04r01, nwalkers=80, rest standard
        Looks OK but should try again with draw guess from priors

- going to run with shear=0.08 for now, nwalkers=80
    - we already have these runs
        - run-eg01r01
        - run-dg03r02
    - add these
        - run-dg03r06 - hold off on this
        - run-eg01r02 - hold off on this
        - run-eg03r01
        - run-dg03r04

- sim-gg01 shear=0.08
    - run-gg01r01 all standard 80,400,200
    - run-gg01r02 importance sampling
        - THIS ONE WAS BUGGY. DO NOT USE
    - run-gg01r03 
        - conjecture is that we need more samples not to get the tails but to
          see the spikiness of the prior.  And the mcmc sampler may not be able
          to sample it?  Who knows.
        - so try applying the prior after to see if we can get some of the
          spikiness
        - not remarkably better, but noiser and might need to sample more to
          see spikiness of prior.

    - run-gg01r04 increase nstep to 800 to see if I can get more spikiness and
      improve shear recovery.  Expect of order 4 hours to finish, 10pm.


- sim-gg04 shear=0.08, sigma ratio 1.0
    - run-gg04rtest3 not doing ring, just to see
        - not enough precision.  maybe come back to it
    - run-gg04r07 try expanding area over which objects are rendered and like
      calculated, etc.
         - rcas2259 slow again
    - also try larger render region.  Maybe "5-sigma" isn't general when the
      object is comparable to psf size?
          - run-gg07r01 not enough stats, but doesn't look good
          - run-gg07r02 more stats.  Same.

- sim-gg05 sigma ratio 1.0 but larger psf
    - same
- sim-gg06 sigma ratio 1.0 but even larger psf
    - same
- sim-gg07 larger render region (8 instead of 5 "sigma")
    - same
- sim-gg08 don't expand true shear; to test if this is because of numerical
  deriv.  This means low shear, 0.01

- near final run types
    - sigma ratio 2
        - gg01r01, but note *did* use priors during. also had error estimate
          wrong so it is actually much lower error.
        - gg01r04 more nstep and no g prior during
        - eg01r04
        - dg03r06
    - sigma ratio 1.4
        - gg03r01
        - eg03r03
            - looks biased low
        - dg04r02
    - sigma ratio 1.0
        - sim-gg04 
            - gg04r01,gg04r02
                - was lower s/n than expected so ran two
                - looks biased.  Maybe error in psf fit affects these smaller
                  objects more?
                    - tried 2 gauss with gg04r03 and looks awful!
                - maybe psf not fully converged?  Use tighter tolerance and
                  higher maxiter?  Did a quick try and psf looks quite close.
                - maybe not burning in?
            - gg04r03
                - same parameters as gg04r01 but trying psf_ngauss=2
                - wow, that looks terrible.
            - gg04r04
                - doubling walkers to 160. Not better. deleted
                - draw truth.  Looks a bit better *maybe*
            - gg04r05
                - mca_a 2.0 didn't help
                - try mca_a 4.0, gives arate ~0.27.  Similar looking.
            - gg04r06
                - try same walkers but double burnin and nstep; doubtful
            - gg04rtest
                - nwalkers 400, no change!
                - try g prior during.  Same
        - sim-eg04
            - eg04r01,eg04r02.  Wierd oscillation in there.  I see it in the
              gg04 stuff as well.
            - eg04r03 TODO
        - sim-dg05
            - dg05r01. running
            - dg05r02 TODO

- try nearly-fixed other paramters besides shape
    - gg02r01 looks crappy!  Is it because we only used 200 step? Doubt it
      since gg01r01 was fine. Simply number of trials? 1,700,000 should be enough..

      This is an important clue.  Could it be the sampler itself? Or how priors
      are calculated?

    - gg02r02 here is where isample should shine, since the priors are actually
      super important on all parameters besides shape

- pop idea
    - measurements
        - N galaxies
        - we have some set of measured parameters; this includes image noise.
    - assumptions
        - assume we know the PSF
        - assume we know the unlensed, intrinsic distribution of all the
          parameters for the underlying population.
        - assume that if a set of galaxies has the same distribution of
          parameters then it has the same shear.
    - procedure 

        - simulate a population of Ns galaxies drawn from the priors, and sheared
          by some specified amount.

        - Test this population of parameters against the one measured from
          the distribution of measured parameters (properly normalized).

        - Repeat and ask which shear value matches better.  Could use a
          non-linear fitter for this.  Take a guess from some simple shear
          estimate.

    - In principle, could use simple parameters like weighted moments.  Could
      even possibly use the *observed* moments rather than some fit?

    - for now probably test simple gaussian simulations, and do a standard fit
      and compare those.

    - the number of model evaluations would be Ns times the number of
      evaluations to get the estimator times the number steps needed to find
      the maximum likelihood.  For Ns=N, 100 steps in a non-linear for the
      estimator, and 100 steps to find the best shear, this would be say
      100*100*N, which is about the same as for the MCMC chain.  Adaptive
      moments would be fewer by probably a factor of ten.  Straight circular
      moments by a factor of 100.


    - practical difficulty is how we do the comparison?  Using a histogram in
      n-dimensions may not be practical.   Can we just look at the mean of some
      ellipticity parameters?

- look at universality of s/n bias vs T_s2n in a maximum likelihood fit or
  expectation value.
      - checked expectation value with priors and dev is quite far off the
        pattern.


- LM
    - run-gg01r05 
    - run-eg01r05
    - run-dg03r07
        - file too big

    - with randomization
    - gg01r06
        - only 1 random realization
    - gg01r07
        - 10 random realizations
        - errors at high s/n. Maybe lm pars?

    - need to get noise right; when calculating s2n_w I'm using all duplicate
      images.  And what about error for the combo over 10 images?  Currenly
      just multiplying by 0.5 inside code; better expand errors before sending
      I think, and let internal code be agnostic.

- metafit idea
    - Do a max like fit, or some other measure, to get a set of "observables".
    - Run a second fit (with guess from max like) to find the intrinsic object
      that would give those observables.  Each step here involves simulating
      the object convolved with the psf, rendering the image, and finding
      the observables.
    - problem  at low s/n the best fit will move all over the place.  This is
      probably prohibitive.
    - nice properties
        - should remove noise bias
        - fully incorporates all the observational details of the data such as
          noise, masked pixels, etc. in the simulation.
    - performance
        - typical number of steps for max like fit is about 50
        - thus a typical number of steps will be 50*50=2500
    - issues
        - failure of initial fit
        - poor errors on initial fit.  At very least we need to soften the
          covariance matrix.

    - gg01rtest
        - tried noise type "diff", difference of image and model.
            - total crap
        - noise type "random"
    - gg01rtest2
    - gg01rtest3
    - gg01rtest4



# old shapesim stuff
- nsim-eg01
    - exp, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-eg01r{01-12} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 20 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r{17-32} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r33 nwalkers 80,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
        - with good s/n overall, but split. (no longer need to make
          multiple runs).  to test if more walkers helps....
          It looks pretty much the same as above.
- nsim-dg01
    - dev, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-dg01r{01-16} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
      fewer splits, so s/n in each is only ~1.0e-4

        - saw large outliers at first, but made guess tight ball around
          true and this went away. Not seen for exp....

    - ngmix-dg01r{17-32} more of the same

    - run-dg01r33
        - nwalkers=20 but new guess, to see if we get the same improvement.

- Things look much better since going to nwalkers=40 and taking a good
  guess.   exp that was already quite good before at this size ratio,
  so it is not much help in the interpretation.  But for dev I saw big
  outliers at intermediate s/n at first even with nwalkers=40, went
  away with better *guess*.
    - Interpretation
        - better guess helped with burnin, got rid of huge outliers for
          dev.  Did not change exp
        - better sampling after burnin generally improved result at low
          s/n
        - this means we might simulate the "better guess" by using
          more burnin.  To get better burnin *and* better sampling,
          would just increase the number of walkers.

    - tests of interpretation
        - use new style guess on dev but with 20 walkers.  If looks
          good then it might not be the sampling of the tails after
          burnin that was the fixer, just the burnin (or good guess).
