# some of these are old names from old shapesim stuff
- nsim-eg01
    - exp, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-eg01r{01-12} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 20 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r{17-32} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r33 nwalkers 80,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
        - with good s/n overall, but split. (no longer need to make
          multiple runs).  to test if more walkers helps....
          It looks pretty much the same as above.
- nsim-dg01
    - dev, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-dg01r{01-16} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
      fewer splits, so s/n in each is only ~1.0e-4

        - saw large outliers at first, but made guess tight ball around
          true and this went away. Not seen for exp....

    - ngmix-dg01r{17-32} more of the same

    - run-dg01r33
        - nwalkers=20 but new guess, to see if we get the same improvement.

- Things look much better since going to nwalkers=40 and taking a good
  guess.   exp that was already quite good before at this size ratio,
  so it is not much help in the interpretation.  But for dev I saw big
  outliers at intermediate s/n at first even with nwalkers=40, went
  away with better *guess*.
    - Interpretation
        - better guess helped with burnin, got rid of huge outliers for
          dev.  Did not change exp
        - better sampling after burnin generally improved result at low
          s/n
        - this means we might simulate the "better guess" by using
          more burnin.  To get better burnin *and* better sampling,
          would just increase the number of walkers.

    - tests of interpretation
        - use new style guess on dev but with 20 walkers.  If looks
          good then it might not be the sampling of the tails after
          burnin that was the fixer, just the burnin (or good guess).
