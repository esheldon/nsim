# vim: set filetype=markdown :

- sim-dg01
    - run-dg01r33 shear 0.01 with nwalkers=20 to verify we still see high bias
        - I do see the bias!  So it was not just the better guess

- sim-dg02
    - run-dg02r01 nwalkers=40 and few s2n vals (should have used 1000 at the
    high end!)
    - run-dg02r02 same as r01 for more statistics

    - run-dg02rtest this can be re-used for other purposes
        - already saw going to 80 walkers does't help that much
        - try nwalkers=40 and mca_a=2?
            - looks like crap!  huh...

- sim-dg03  shear 0.08, see if OK at high shear
    - run-dg03r01 nwalkers=40, s/n starting at 10
    - run-dg03r02 nwalkers=80
        - looks better!  So is it the nwalkers, burnin or the nstep?
            - run with nwalkers=40 but nstep  doubled to 400
            - run with nwalkers=40 but burnin doubled to 800
    - run-dg03r03 nwalkers=40, nstep=400 (doubled nstep, burnin same)
        - looks similar to r02
    - run-dg03r04 nwalkers=40, burnin=800 (doubled burnin, nstep same)
        - looks in between

    - so these are probably burnt in, but more sampling was needed. Real data
      may not burn in as quickly. options:
        - nwalkers=40 burnin=400 nstep=400 known bias
        - nwalkers=80 burnin=400 nstep=200 known bias
        - nwalkers=80 burnin=200 nstep=200 even less burnin
        - nwalkers=40 burnin=400 nstep=800 see if more nstep helps.
            - I think it is more important at this stage to look for better
              accuracy.  Let's do it

    - run-dg03r05 nwalkers=40, burnin=40, nstep=8000

    - so dg02 with 40 looks as good as dg03 with 80.  Is this some problem with
      expanding about 0.08 shear, where the shapes get very close to unity and
      the prob is zero?  I think these have pj==0. But there should be a tiny
      number of them.

# some of these are old names from old shapesim stuff
- nsim-eg01
    - exp, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-eg01r{01-12} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 20 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r{17-32} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
    - ngmix-eg01r33 nwalkers 80,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
        - with good s/n overall, but split. (no longer need to make
          multiple runs).  to test if more walkers helps....
          It looks pretty much the same as above.
- nsim-dg01
    - dev, sigma ratio 2 (T ratio 4)
    - ngmix-dg01r{01-16} nwalkers 40,burnin 400, nstep 200, 11 s2n bins
      fewer splits, so s/n in each is only ~1.0e-4

        - saw large outliers at first, but made guess tight ball around
          true and this went away. Not seen for exp....

    - ngmix-dg01r{17-32} more of the same

    - run-dg01r33
        - nwalkers=20 but new guess, to see if we get the same improvement.

- Things look much better since going to nwalkers=40 and taking a good
  guess.   exp that was already quite good before at this size ratio,
  so it is not much help in the interpretation.  But for dev I saw big
  outliers at intermediate s/n at first even with nwalkers=40, went
  away with better *guess*.
    - Interpretation
        - better guess helped with burnin, got rid of huge outliers for
          dev.  Did not change exp
        - better sampling after burnin generally improved result at low
          s/n
        - this means we might simulate the "better guess" by using
          more burnin.  To get better burnin *and* better sampling,
          would just increase the number of walkers.

    - tests of interpretation
        - use new style guess on dev but with 20 walkers.  If looks
          good then it might not be the sampling of the tails after
          burnin that was the fixer, just the burnin (or good guess).
